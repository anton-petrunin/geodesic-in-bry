\begin{abstract}
We give a necessary condition on a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold that can run in some convex hypersurface.
As a corollary we obtain a number of peculiar properties of \emph{all} convex sets that holds true in \emph{generic} Riemannian manifolds $M$ of dimension at least 3.
In particular, the boundary of any convex set in $M$ contains at most countable set of geodesics.

\section{Introduction}
Let $\mathfrak{C}$ be the convex hull of a compact subset $A$ in a Euclidean space.
By Carathéodory's theorem, any point in $\mathfrak{C}\setminus A$ is an inner point of a geodesic contained in $\mathfrak{C}$.
In particular, if $\mathfrak{C}$ has a non-empty interior, then $\partial \mathfrak{C} \setminus A$ is  a union of geodesics.  
These well-known statements admit straightforward generalizations to the sphere and the hyperbolic space.
 
The above statement is also easy to prove in all simply connected non-positively curved surfaces and locally in any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Recall that a set $\mathfrak{C}$ in a Riemannian manifold $M$ is called \emph{convex} if for any pair of points $x,y\in \mathfrak{C}$ any minimizing geodesic $[x,y]$ lies in $\mathfrak{C}$.
A point $x\in \mathfrak{C}$ is called \emph{extremal} if it does not lie in an interior of a geodesic in $\mathfrak{C}$.

It seems to be a folklore belief that a version of this statement should hold true in all Riemannian manifolds. 
For instance, it is claimed by Mohammad Ghomi and Joel Spruck \cite[Lemma 9.1]{Ghomi}.
In the present note we prove that the somewhat counter-intuitive opposite is the case for \emph{generic} Riemannian manifolds. 
Following \cite{eliashberg-mishachev}, we say that a \emph{generic Riemannian metric on a given class on manifold $M$ 
has a property $P$} if the set of metric tensors $g$ that satisfy $P$ is open and dense in the space of all Riemannian metric tensors of the given class.
Since the space of Riemannian metrics is \emph{Baire}, we may say that most of Riemannian metrics are generic.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with dimesnion at least 3.
Then, generic smooth Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ satisfies the following properties:

\begin{subthm}{}
The set of extremal points of any closed convex set $\mathfrak{C}\subset (M,g)$ is dense in~$\partial\mathfrak{C}$
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
Any convex set $\mathfrak{C}\subset (M,g)$ either is a subset of a geodesic, or has nonempty interior.
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{}
Let $A_1$ be any compact non-convex  subset of $(M,g)$, not contained in a minimizing  geodesic. Define  $A_k$ inductively as  the union of all minimizing geodesics connecting pairs of  points in 
$A_{k-1}$.
Then, $A_{k+1}\supsetneq A_k$ for all $k$;
that is, $A_k$ is not convex for any $k$.
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{}
For any convex closed set $\mathfrak{C}\subset (M,g)$ at most countable set of geodesics of $(M,g)$ contain all the geodesics that run in~$\partial\mathfrak{C}$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parbf{About the proof.}
The proofs of all these statements are built on the following key lemma.
Its formulation uses the notion of \emph{tangent cone} to a convex set which we are about define.

Given a point $x$ in a closed convex set $\mathfrak{C}$, define its tangent cone $\K_x\mathfrak{C}$ as the closure of subset of tangent space $\T_x$ formed by all velocity vectors of geodesics that start at $x$ and run in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Note that if $x$ lies in the interior of $\mathfrak{C}$, then $\K_x\mathfrak{C}=\T_x$.
 
\begin{thm}{Key lemma}
Suppose that a geodesic $\gamma$ lies in a closed convex set $\mathfrak{C}$ of a Riemannian manifold $M$.
Then the tangent cone of $\mathfrak{C}$ is parallel along $\gamma$; that is, the parallel translation along $\gamma$ defines a bijection between the tangent cones $\K_x\mathfrak{C}$ and $\K_y\mathfrak{C}$ of any two interior points $x$ to $y$ of $\gamma$.

Moreover, for any $V\in \K_x\mathfrak{C}$ we have
\[\Rm(V,\gamma')\gamma'\in \K_V[\K_x\mathfrak{C}],\]
where $\Rm$ denotes the curvature tensor of $M$.
\end{thm}
  
  
\section{Jets of metric tenors}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.
Recall that $\Rm$ denotes the curvature tensor.

Choose a tangent vector $X_p\in \T_pM$; 
extend $X_p\in \T_p$ to a parallel vector field $X$ in the normal coordinates at $p$.
That is, set 
\[X_{\exp_pW}=(d_W\exp_p)X_p\] for all small $W\in \T_p$.
Note that $(\nabla^k_X X)_p=0$ for any $k\ge 1$.

Set 
\[R=R(X)\:V\mapsto \Rm(V,X)X.\]
Given a tensor field $S$, let us use the shortcut $S'$  for $\nabla_XS$ at $p$.
In particular, set
\[R^{(k)}=R^{(k)}(X)\df\nabla^k_XR(X).\]
Note that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R^{(k)}(X)\:\T_p\to\T_p$ is a self-adjoint operator and
\item $X\mapsto R^{(k)}(X)$ is a homogenius polynomial of degree $k+2$ defined for all $X\in \T_p$.
\end{itemize}

 


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:jacobi}
For any tangent vector $X$ at a point $p$ of a Riemannian manifold manifold $M$ and any integer $n$ there are three self-adjoint operators 
\[A_n=A_n(X),\ B_n=B_n(X),\ C_n=C_n(X)\:\T_p\to \T_p\]
that satisfy the following conditions:

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:ABC}
For any Jacobi field $I$ along the geodesic $\gamma\:t\mapsto \exp_p(t\cdot X)$ the following identity holds:
\[\langle I,I\rangle^{(n)}
=
\langle A_n\cdot  I,I\rangle+ \langle B_n\cdot I, I'\rangle+\langle C_n\cdot I', I'\rangle.\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:R}
 $X\mapsto A_{n}(X)$, $X\mapsto B_{n+1}(X)$ and $X\mapsto C_{n+2}(X)$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ defined for all $X\in \T_p$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:A-R}
The following differences  
\[A_{n+2}-2\cdot R^{(n)},
\quad 
B_{n+3}-4\cdot(n+2)\cdot R^{(n)},
\quad
C_{n+4}-2\cdot(n+1)\cdot(n+4)\cdot R^{(n)}\]
depend only on $R,R',\dots, R^{(n-2)}$.
\end{subthm}


\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Applying recursively the Jacobi identity $I''=-R\cdot I$ for the geodesic $\gamma\:t\mapsto\exp_p(t\cdot X)$, we get that the following identity 
\[\langle I,I\rangle^{(n)}
=
\langle A_n\cdot  I,I\rangle+ \langle B_n\cdot I,I'\rangle+\langle C_n\cdot I',I'\rangle\]
where $A_0=1$, $B_0=0$, $C_0=0$, and the operators $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ satisfy the following recursive relations:
\begin{align*}
A_{n+1}&=A_n'-\tfrac12\cdot R\cdot B_n-\tfrac12\cdot B_n\cdot R
\\
B_{n+1}&=B_n'+ 2\cdot A_n-C_n\cdot R-R\cdot C_n
\\
C_{n+1}&=C_n'+ B_n
\end{align*}

It proves part \ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:ABC};
by looking at the table, and applying induction, one gets~\ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:R} and~\ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:A-R}.\qeds

Following \cite{eliashberg-mishachev}, we will denote by $J^n_g(p)$ the $n$-jet of a metric tensor $g$ at the point $p$;
it cares information on all partial derivatives of $g$ at $p$ up to order~$n$ in some (and therefore every) local coordinate system at $p$.
Equivalently, the jet $J^n_g(p)$ can be described by Taylor expansion up to degree $n$ of $g$ at $p$ (in some, and therefore every, local coordinate system at $p$).

Assume $g$ is positive definite at $p$.
Note that $J^n_g(p)$ determines the polynomials 
$X\mapsto R(X)$, $X\mapsto R'(X),\dots, X\mapsto R^{(n-2)}(X)$ defined for all $X\in \T_p$. 
In other words, the map 
\[\rho_n\:J^n_g(p)\mapsto (R,\dots,R^{(n-2)})\]
is defined.
The domain $\Dom \rho_n\subset J^n_g(p)$ of $\rho_n$ is the open set of all $n$-jets such that $g$ is positive definite at $p$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:submersion}
The map $\rho_n$ is a submersion;
that is, for any jet $J^n_g(p)\z\in \Dom \rho_n$ the differential $d_{J^n_g(p)}\rho_n$ has a right inverse.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Choose a Riemannian metric $g$ in a neighborhood of $p$.
Let $C_i=C_i(X)$ be as in \ref{lem:jacobi}.

Choose another vector filed $V$ that is parallel in the normal coordinates at~$p$.

Set $V_t=V(\exp_p(t\cdot X))$ and $I_t=t\cdot V_t$.
Note that $I$ is a Jacobi field along $\gamma$.
Observe that $t^2\cdot \langle V_t, V_t\rangle=\langle I_t, I_t\rangle$, $I(0)=0$, and $I'(0)=V(0)$.
Applying \ref{lem:jacobi}, we get
\[g(I_t, I_t)=\sum_{i=0}^{n+2}\tfrac1{(n+2)!}\cdot\langle C_n(X)\cdot V_0,V_0\rangle\cdot t^{n+2}+o(t^{n+2}).\]
Since $X$ is arbitrary, we get the equality
\[g( V, V)=\sum_{i=2}^{n+2}\tfrac1{(n+2)!}\cdot\langle C_n(X)\cdot V_0,V_0\rangle+o(|X|^{n})\]
at the point $\exp_p X$.
It follows that in the normal coordinates at $p$,
the $n$-jet $J^n_g(p)$ is uniquely described by the polynomials
\[X\mapsto C_2(X),
\ \dots\ ,\  
X\mapsto C_{n+2}(X).\]

Applying \ref{lem:jacobi:A-R} inductively on $n$, we get that the differential 
$d_{J^n_g(p)}\rho_n$ has a right inverse $s$.
Moreover $s$ can be chosen so that the jets in its image correspond to metric tensors that share the normal coordinates with $g$.
Hence the proposition follows.

\section{Genericity}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$.
Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ satisfies the following property:
There is no tangent vector $X\ne 0$ such that the operators
$R(X), R'(X)$, and $R''(X)$ have a common eigenvector.
\end{thm}

The proposition follows from the Thom transversality theorem \cite[2.3.2]{eliashberg-mishachev}, \ref{prop:submersion}, and the following lemma.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $S^k$ be the space of all $k$-tuples $A_1,\dots A_k$ of self-adjoint operators $\RR^n\to\RR^n$.
Then the set $E$ of all $k$-tuples $(A_1,...A_k) \in S^k$  having a common eigenvector is an algebraic subset of $S^k$ of codimension $(m-1)\cdot (k-1)$.
\end{thm}

\section{Jacobi fields}

Тhe next observation which follows immediately from the fact that Jacobi fields describe the difference between infinitesimally close geodesics.
All the proofs in this section are based on this observation.


\begin{thm}{Observation}
Let  $\mathfrak{C}$ be a closed convex subset in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$
Suppose that $\gamma\:(0,1)\to\mathfrak{C}$ be a geodesic in $(M,g)$ and $I$ is a Jacobi field along $\gamma$.
Assume that $I(t_0)\in \K_{\gamma(t_0)}\mathfrak{C}$ and $I(t_1)\in \K_{\gamma(t_1)}\mathfrak{C}$ for some $0<t_0<t_1<1$.
Then $I(t)\in \K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ for any $t\in [t_0,t_1]$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} 
Choose a subinterval $[a,b]$ in the domain of $\gamma$.
Given a large positive integer $k$, consider arithmetic progression
$(t_i)$ such that $t_0=a$, $t_k=b$.

Givena tangent vector $I=I_0\in\T_{\gamma(a)}$, consider the sequence of vectors $I_i\in\in\T_{\gamma(t_i)}$ recurcevely by $I_{i+1}=2\cdot I_i(t_{i+1})$ where $I_i(t)$ denotes the Jacobi field along $\gamma$ such that $I_i(t_i)=I_i$ and $I_i(t_{i+2})=0$.

By observation, if $I_0\in \K_{\gamma(a)}$ then $I_k\in \K_{\gamma(b)}$.
Note that $I_k\in\T_{\gamma(b)}$ and, as $k\to \infty$, the $I_k$ converges to the parallel translation of $I_0$ along $\gamma$.
It follows that parallel translation along $\gamma$ maps $\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ in $\K_{\gamma(b)}\mathfrak{C}$ and the other way around.
That is, $K_\gamma(t)$ is parallel along $\gamma$.

Let us use parallel translation along $\gamma$ to identify the tangent spaces at the points on $\gamma$.
This way we will identify the tangent cones $K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ for all $t$;
denote the obtained cone by $K_\gamma\mathfrak{C}$.

Consider a Jacobi field $I$ such that $I(t_0)=I(t_1)$.
Note that 
\[I(\tfrac{t_0+t_1}2)=I(t_0)+\tfrac14\cdot(t_1-t_0)^2\cdot R(X)\cdot I+o((t_1-t_0)^2).\]
According to the observation, $I(\tfrac{t_0+t_1}2)\in \K_{\gamma(\frac{t_0+t_1}2)} \mathfrak{C}$.
Therefore $R(X)\cdot I\in \K_I\K_\gamma\mathfrak{C}$.
