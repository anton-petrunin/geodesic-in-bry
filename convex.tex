\begin{abstract}
We give a necessary condition on a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold that can run in some convex hypersurface.
As a corollary we obtain a number of peculiar properties of \emph{all} convex sets that hold true in \emph{generic} Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$.
In particular, we show that the set of non-extreme points on the boundary of any convex set in $(M,g)$
is a union of a countable set of geodesics.

\section{Introduction}
Let $\mathfrak{C}$ be the convex hull of a subset $A$ in a Euclidean space.
By Carathéodory's theorem, any point in $\mathfrak{C}\setminus A$ is an inner point of a geodesic contained in $\mathfrak{C}$;
that is, the complement $\mathfrak{C} \setminus A$ does not contain extreme points of $\mathfrak{C}$.  
These well-known statements admit straightforward generalizations to the sphere and the Lobachevskian space.
 
The above statement is also easy to prove in all simply connected non-positively curved surfaces;
morover, locally it holds true in any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Recall that a set $\mathfrak{C}$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is called \emph{convex} if for any pair of points $x,y\in \mathfrak{C}$ any minimizing geodesic $[x,y]$ lies in $\mathfrak{C}$.
A point in $\mathfrak{C}$ is called \emph{extreme} if it does not lie in an interior of a geodesic in~$\mathfrak{C}$.

It seems to be a folklore belief that a version of this statement should hold true in all Riemannian manifolds. 
For instance, it is claimed by Mohammad Ghomi and Joel Spruck \cite[Lemma 9.1]{Ghomi}.
In the present note we prove that the somewhat counter-intuitive opposite is the case for \emph{generic} Riemannian manifolds. 

Following \cite{eliashberg-mishachev}, we say that a \emph{generic Riemannian metric $g$ on a manifold $M$ 
has a property $P$} if the set of metric tensors $g$ that satisfy $P$ is open and dense in the space of all Riemannian metrics on $M$.
Since the space of Riemannian metrics on $M$ is \emph{Baire}, we may say that \emph{most} of Riemannian metrics are generic.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with dimension at least 3.

Then, for generic smooth Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$,
any closed convex set $\mathfrak{C}\subset (M,g)$ that is not a subset of a geodesic
satisfies the following properties:

\begin{subthm}{}
The set $\mathfrak{C}$ has nonempty interior.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
The set of all non-extreme points $\partial\mathfrak{C}$ can be covered by a countable set of geodesics of $(M,g)$.
In particular, the set of extreme points of $\mathfrak{C}$ is dense in~$\partial\mathfrak{C}$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

Note that the theorem implies that an analog of Carathéodory theorem does not hold in most of Riemannian manifolds.
Namely, we get the following corollary:

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:caratheodory}
Suppose that $g$ is a generic Riemannian metric on a smooth connected manifold $M$ with dimension at least 3.
Let $A_1$ be any compact non-convex  subset of $(M,g)$, not contained in a minimizing  geodesic.
Define  $A_k$ inductively as  the union of all minimizing geodesics connecting pairs of  points in 
$A_{k-1}$.
Then, either $A_k=M$ for some $k$, or $A_{k+1}\supsetneq A_k$ for all $k$;
the latter means that $A_k$ is not convex for any $k$.
\end{thm}


The proofs of these statements are built on the key lemma stated in the following section; 
it describes a necessary condition on a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold that can run in some convex hypersurface.
The remaining part is nearly self-evident;
its formal proofs use Thom transversality theorem, and it takes the remaining sections.

\section{Key lemma}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold;
we will often use shortcut $\langle \vec{v},\vec{w}\rangle$ for $g(\vec{v},\vec{w})$.

Let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a closed convex set in $(M,g)$.
Given a point $x\in \mathfrak{C}$, define its tangent cone $\K_x\mathfrak{C}\subset \T_x$ as the closure of the set of all velocity vectors of geodesics that start at $x$ and run in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Note that $x$ lies in the interior of $\mathfrak{C}$ if and only if $\K_x\mathfrak{C}=\T_x$.

Given a tangent vector $\vec{x}\in\T_pM$, set
\[R(\vec{x})\:\vec{v}\mapsto \Rm(\vec{v},\vec{x})\vec{x},\]
where $\Rm$ denotes the curvature tensor of $(M,g)$.
Note that $R(\vec{x})\:\T_p\to \T_p$ is a self-adjoint operator.
The Jacobi equation along a geodesic $\gamma$ can be written as 
\[\vec{i}''+R(\gamma')\cdot \vec{i}=0,\]
here  $\vec{i}''$ is a shortcut for $\nabla^2_{\gamma'}\vec{i}$.
 
\begin{thm}{Key lemma}\label{lem:key}
Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\gamma$ is a geodesic in $(M,g)$ that is defined on an open interval.
Suppose that $\gamma$ lies in a closed convex set $\mathfrak{C}\subset (M,g)$.
Then the tangent cone of $\mathfrak{C}$ is parallel along $\gamma$; that is, the parallel translation along $\gamma$ defines a bijection between the tangent cones $\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ and $\K_{\gamma(b)}\mathfrak{C}$ for any $a$ and $b$.

Moreover
\begin{subthm}{}
For any $\vec{v}\in \K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ we have
\[R(\gamma'(a))\cdot \vec{v}\in \K_\vec{v}[\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}].\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} Let $L(a)$ be the maximal linear subspace of $\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$.
Then $L(a)$ is an invariant subspace of $R(\gamma'(a))$ for any $a$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

The proof is based on the next observation;
it follows immediately from the fact that Jacobi fields describe the difference between infinitesimally close geodesics.

\begin{thm}{Observation}
Let  $\mathfrak{C}$ be a closed convex subset in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$.
Suppose $\vec{i}$ is a Jacobi field along a geodesic $\gamma\:[a,b]\to \mathfrak{C}$ in $(M,g)$.
Assume that $\vec{i}(a)\in \K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ and $\vec{i}(b)\in \K_{\gamma(b)}\mathfrak{C}$.
Then $\vec{i}(t)\in \K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ for any $t\in [a,b]$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of \ref{lem:key}.} 
Choose a subinterval $[a,b]$ in the domain of $\gamma$.
Given a large positive integer $k$, consider arithmetic progression
$(t_i)$ such that $t_0=a$, $t_k=b$.

Choose a tangent vector $\vec{i}_0\in\T_{\gamma(a)}$. 
Consider the sequence of vectors $\vec{i}_i\z\in\T_{\gamma(t_i)}$ defined recursively by $\vec{i}_{i+1}=2\cdot \vec{i}_i(t_{i+1})$, where $t\mapsto \vec{i}_i(t)$ is the Jacobi field along $\gamma$ such that $\vec{i}_i(t_i)=\vec{i}_i$ and $\vec{i}_i(t_{i+2})=0$;
since $k$ is large, the mentioned Jacobi fields are uniquely defined.

Define $\iota_k\:\T_{\gamma(a)}\to \T_{\gamma(b)}$ by setting $\iota_k(\vec{i}_0)\df \vec{i}_k$.
According to the observation, if $\vec{i}_0\in \K_{\gamma(a)}$, then $\iota_k(\vec{i}_0)\in \K_{\gamma(b)}$.
Note that $\iota_k(\vec{i}_0)$ converges to the parallel translation of $\vec{i}_0$ along $\gamma$ as $k\to \infty$.
It follows that parallel translation along $\gamma$ maps $\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ in $\K_{\gamma(b)}\mathfrak{C}$.
Swapping $a$ and $b$, we get the opposite inclusion.
That is, the tangent cone $K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ is parallel along $\gamma$.

Let us use parallel translation along $\gamma$ to identify the tangent spaces at the points on $\gamma$.
This way we will identify the tangent cones $K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ for all $t$;
denote the obtained cone by $K_\gamma\mathfrak{C}$.

Choose $\vec{i}_0\in K_\gamma\mathfrak{C}$ and $\eps>0$;
consider the Jacobi field $\vec{i}$ such that $\vec{i}(a+\eps)\z=\vec{i}(a+\eps)=\vec{i}_0$.
By Jacobi equation, we have
\[\vec{i}(a)=\vec{i}_0+\eps^2\cdot R(\gamma'(a))\cdot \vec{i}_0+o(\eps^2).\]
According to the observation, $\vec{i}(a)\in \K_{\gamma} \mathfrak{C}$ for any $\eps>0$.
Since $\K_{\gamma} \mathfrak{C}$ is closed, we get $R(\gamma')\cdot \vec{i}\z\in \K_\vec{i}[\K_\gamma\mathfrak{C}]$.

Finally note that $\vec{i}\in L(a)$ if and only if $\K_\vec{i}[\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}]=\K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$.
Therefore, if $\vec{i}\in L(a)$, then $\pm R(\gamma'(a))\cdot \vec{i}\in \K_{\gamma(a)}\mathfrak{C}$ and hence $R(\gamma'(a))\cdot \vec{i}\in L(a)$.
That is, $L(a)$ is invariant subspace of $ R(\gamma'(a))$ for any $a$.

\section{Taylor expansion of metric tensor}\label{sec:jet}

In this section we calculate the Taylor expansion of metric tensor in the normal coordinates.
This formula was derived by Old\v{r}ich Kowalski and Martin Belger \cite[Proposition 2.2]{kowalski-belger} (that is the earliest reference we have found),
but we present calculations since some notations will be used further.

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.
Recall that $\Rm$ denotes the curvature tensor.

Choose a tangent vector $\vec{x}_p\in \T_pM$; 
extend it to a parallel vector field $\vec{x}$ in the normal coordinates at $p$.
That is, set 
\[\vec{x}_{\exp_p\vec{w}}=(d_\vec{w}\exp_p)\vec{x}_p\] for all small $\vec{w}\in \T_p$.
Note that $(\nabla^k_\vec{x} \vec{x})_p=0$ for any $k\ge 1$.

Given a tensor field $S$, let us use the shortcut $S'$  for $\nabla_\vec{x}S$ at $p$.
Recall that $R=R(\vec{x})\:\vec{v}\mapsto \Rm(\vec{v},\vec{x})\vec{x}$.
Therefore
\[R^{(k)}=R^{(k)}(\vec{x})\df\nabla^k_\vec{x}R(\vec{x}).\]
Note that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R^{(k)}(\vec{x})\:\T_p\to\T_p$ is a self-adjoint operator, 
\item $\vec{x}\perp R^{(k)}(\vec{x})\cdot \vec{v}$ for any vector field $\vec{v}$, and
\item $\vec{x}\mapsto R^{(k)}(\vec{x})$ is a homogenius polynomial of degree $k+2$ defined for all $\vec{x}\in \T_p$.
\end{itemize}

 


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:jacobi}
For any tangent vector $\vec{x}$ at a point $p$ of a Riemannian manifold manifold $(M,g)$ and any integer $n$ there are three self-adjoint operators 
\[A_n=A_n(\vec{x}),\ B_n=B_n(\vec{x}),\ C_n=C_n(\vec{x})\:\T_p\to \T_p\]
that satisfy the following conditions:

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:ABC}
For any Jacobi field $\vec{i}$ along the geodesic $\gamma\:t\mapsto \exp_p(t\cdot \vec{x})$ the following identity holds:
\[\langle \vec{i},\vec{i}\rangle^{(n)}
=
\langle A_n\cdot  \vec{i},\vec{i}\rangle+ \langle B_n\cdot \vec{i}, \vec{i}'\rangle+\langle C_n\cdot \vec{i}', \vec{i}'\rangle.\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:R}
 $\vec{x}\mapsto A_{n}(\vec{x})$, $\vec{x}\mapsto B_{n+1}(\vec{x})$ and $\vec{x}\mapsto C_{n+2}(\vec{x})$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ defined for all $\vec{x}\in \T_p$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:jacobi:A-R}
The following differences  
\[A_{n+2}-2\cdot R^{(n)},
\quad 
B_{n+3}-4\cdot(n+2)\cdot R^{(n)},
\quad
C_{n+4}-2\cdot(n+1)\cdot(n+4)\cdot R^{(n)}\]
depend only on $R,R',\dots, R^{(n-2)}$.
\end{subthm}


\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Applying recursively the Jacobi identity $\vec{i}''=-R\cdot \vec{i}$ for the geodesic $\gamma\:t\mapsto\exp_p(t\cdot \vec{x})$, we get that the following identity 
\[\langle \vec{i},\vec{i}\rangle^{(n)}
=
\langle A_n\cdot  \vec{i},\vec{i}\rangle+ \langle B_n\cdot \vec{i},\vec{i}'\rangle+\langle C_n\cdot \vec{i}',\vec{i}'\rangle\]
where $A_0=1$, $B_0=0$, $C_0=0$, and the operators $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ satisfy the following recursive relations:
\begin{align*}
A_{n+1}&=A_n'-\tfrac12\cdot R\cdot B_n-\tfrac12\cdot B_n\cdot R
\\
B_{n+1}&=B_n'+ 2\cdot A_n-C_n\cdot R-R\cdot C_n
\\
C_{n+1}&=C_n'+ B_n
\end{align*}

It proves part \ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:ABC};
by looking at the table, and applying induction, one gets~\ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:R} and~\ref{SHORT.lem:jacobi:A-R}.\qeds

Following \cite{eliashberg-mishachev}, we will denote by $J^n_g(p)$ the $n$-jet of a metric tensor $g$ at the point $p$;
it cares information on all partial derivatives of $g$ at $p$ up to order~$n$ in some (and therefore every) local coordinate system at $p$.
Equivalently, the jet $J^n_g(p)$ can be described by Taylor expansion up to degree $n$ of $g$ at $p$ (in some, and therefore every, local coordinate system at $p$).

Assume $g$ is positive definite at $p$.
Note that $J^n_g(p)$ determines the polynomials 
$\vec{x}\mapsto R(\vec{x})$, $\vec{x}\mapsto R'(\vec{x}),\dots, \vec{x}\mapsto R^{(n-2)}(\vec{x})$ defined for all $\vec{x}\in \T_p$. 
In other words, the map 
\[\rho_n\:J^n_g(p)\mapsto (R,\dots,R^{(n-2)})\]
is defined.
The domain $\Dom \rho_n\subset J^n_g(p)$ of $\rho_n$ is the open set of all $n$-jets such that $g$ is positive definite at $p$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:submersion}
For any jet $J^n_g(p)\z\in \Dom \rho_n$ the differential $d_{J^n_g(p)}\rho_n$ has a right inverse $s$.
Moreover $s$ can be chosen so that the jets in its image correspond to metric tensors that share the normal coordinates with $g$.

In particular, the map $\rho_n$ is a submersion.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Choose a Riemannian metric $g$ in a neighborhood of $p$.
Let $C_i=C_i(\vec{x})$ be as in \ref{lem:jacobi}.

Choose a vector filed $\vec{v}$ that is parallel in the normal coordinates at~$p$;
that is, $\vec{v}_{\exp_p\vec{w}}=(d_\vec{w}\exp_p)\vec{v}_p$ for some $\vec{v}_p\in\T_p$ and all small $\vec{w}\in \T_p$.

Set $\vec{v}(t)=\vec{v}_{\exp_p(t\cdot \vec{x})}$ and $\vec{i}(t)=t\cdot \vec{v}(t)$.
Note that $\vec{i}$ is a Jacobi field along the geodesic $t\mapsto \exp_p(t\cdot \vec{x})$.
Observe that 
\[t^2\cdot \langle \vec{v}(t),
\vec{v}(t)\rangle=\langle \vec{i}(t), \vec{i}(t)\rangle,
\quad 
\vec{i}(0)=0,
\quad 
\text{and} \quad 
\vec{i}'(0)\z=\vec{v}_p.\]
Applying \ref{lem:jacobi}, we get
\[\langle\vec{i}(t), \vec{i}(t)\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n+2}\tfrac1{(n+2)!}\cdot\langle C_n(\vec{x})\cdot \vec{v}_p,\vec{v}_p\rangle\cdot t^{n+2}+o(t^{n+2}).\]
Applying the last identity for $t=1$ and arbitrary $\vec{x}$, we get the equality
\[\langle\vec{v}, \vec{v}\rangle=\sum_{i=2}^{n+2}\tfrac1{(n+2)!}\cdot\langle C_n(\vec{x})\cdot \vec{v}_p,\vec{v}_p\rangle+o(|\vec{x}|^{n})\]
at the point $\exp_p \vec{x}$.
It follows that in the normal coordinates at $p$,
the $n$-jet $J^n_g(p)$ is uniquely described by the polynomials
\[\vec{x}\mapsto C_2(\vec{x}),
\ \dots\ ,\  
\vec{x}\mapsto C_{n+2}(\vec{x}).\]

It remains to applying \ref{lem:jacobi:A-R} inductively on $n$.

\section{Genericity}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:R'}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$.
Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ satisfies the following property:
for any tangent vector $\vec{x}\ne 0$ the operators
$R(\vec{x}), R'(\vec{x}), \dots, R^{(4)}(\vec{x})$ have only two nontrivial common invariant subspaces: the 1-dimensional space spanned by $\vec{x}$ and its orthogonal complement.
\end{thm}

%it is true without assumption n\ge 3, but might be misleading

The proposition follows from the Thom transversality theorem \cite[2.3.2]{eliashberg-mishachev}, \ref{prop:submersion}, and the following lemma.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $\mathfrak{S}_{k,n}$ be the space of all $k$-tuples $A_1,\dots, A_k$ of self-adjoint operators $\RR^{n-1}\to\RR^{n-1}$.
Then the set of all $k$-tuples $(A_1,...,A_k) \in \mathfrak{S}_{k,n}$ having a common nontrivial invariant subspace is an algebraic subset of $\mathfrak{S}_{k,n}$ of codimension $(n-2)\cdot (k-1)$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}\qeds

\parit{Proof of the main theorem (\ref{thm:main}).}
Choose a geodesic $\gamma$ of $(M,g)$ defined on an open interval.
Assume that $L(t)\subset K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ is provided by the key lemma (\ref{lem:key}).
Since the tangent cone $K_{\gamma(t)}\mathfrak{C}$ is parallel along $\gamma$, so is $L(t)$.

By the key lemma, $L(t)$ is invariant subspace of $R(\gamma'(t))$ for any~$t$.
Taking derivatives by $t$, we get that $L(t)$ is invariant subspace of $R^{(k)}(\gamma'(t))$ for any positive integer $k$.

Evidently $L(t)\ni \gamma'(t)$.
If $\gamma$ runs in the boundary $\partial\mathfrak{C}$, then $L(t)\subsetneq\T_{\gamma(t)}$.
Since $g$ is generic,
by \ref{prop:R'}, it follows that $L(t)$ is the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by $\gamma'(t)$.
